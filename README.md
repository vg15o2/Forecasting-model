Objective and Data Analysis:
The project focuses on predicting and analyzing air pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, NO, NO2, NOx, SO2, Ozone, Benzene, etc.) in Shadipur, Delhi, across different phases of the COVID-19 lockdown. Techniques like Fourier transforms and seasonal decomposition were used to preprocess data, handle missing values, and analyze seasonal patterns.

Model Development and Evaluation:
Multiple machine learning and artificial intelligence models, including MLP, BPNN, RBFNN, SVR, and WNN, were developed and evaluated using metrics such as RMSE, MSE, MAE, RÂ², and Taylor diagrams. The Wavelet Neural Network (WNN) consistently outperformed other models in forecasting pollutant concentrations.

Validation and Uncertainty Analysis:
Temporal cross-validation with sensitivity analysis was employed to determine the optimal number of folds for training and testing. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to assess the reliability and uncertainty of the predictions.

Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown:
The project analyzed pollutant trends during 2020 by dividing the year into five phases: Pre-lockdown, Strict Lockdown, Relaxed Lockdown, Liberal Lockdown, and After-Lockdown. Trends and concentration levels were statistically analyzed and visually represented to study the lockdown's impact on air quality.

Insights and Applications:
The study highlighted the WNN model's effectiveness in forecasting pollutants and offered valuable insights into pollutant behaviors and origins. The findings provide a foundation for air quality management, public health initiatives, and policy-making to address environmental concerns.
